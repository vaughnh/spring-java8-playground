# spring-java8-playground
A mostly useless playground for expressing simple operations using Java 8 and modern Spring boot.

This project includes a maven wrapper https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper. If the
wrapper needs to be rebuilt mvn -N io.takari:maven:wrapper -Dmaven=3.3.9.

You can execute maven by using the included wrapper script
```
./mvnw package
```
This project also uses spring boot and apache derby.
